"""This module provides functionality for processing GPX files into
structured geographic data models. It leverages asynchronous parsing to
handle waypoints, trackpoints, and routepoints within GPX files,
converting them into a list of PointModel instances. Each PointModel
instance represents a geographic point with its latitude, longitude, and
converted Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) coordinates.

The module integrates components for parsing GPX files and converting geographic coordinates
to ensure efficient processing and accurate data representation.

Functions:
- process_gpx_to_point_models: Converts GPX file contents into a list of PointModel instances.
