"""Provides functionality for exporting geographic point models to
different file formats.

Currently supports exporting to JSON format. This module serves as a hub for
conversion utilities, facilitating the serialization of geographic data represented
by point models into various standardized and custom file types for external use
and analysis.

Available Functions:
- point_models_to_json: Exports a list of PointModel instances to a JSON file.

Future expansions may include additional file format support such as CSV, XML,
and others tailored to specific geographic data handling needs.
