Type Stubs for mgrs.core

This module provides type stubs for the `mgrs.core` package. The actual `mgrs` library does not include
type annotations or a `py.typed` marker, which means static type checkers like `mypy` cannot infer
the types of classes, functions, or methods provided by `mgrs.core`.

The stubs are intended to be a minimal representation, focusing only on the parts of `mgrs.core` that
are actively used, and may need to be extended if additional functionality from the `mgrs` library is
utilized in the future.
